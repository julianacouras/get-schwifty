TravelBug consists on a machine learning algorithm - a decision tree - that help people making decisions about their next travel destination. 

Tired of reading lots of reviews and still not knowing where to go? TravelBug can save you time! Answer a couple of questions and it will suggest you 10 cities at most.
Our decision tree learned based on a "humanized" database, all the data was obtained based on human answers to previous surveys. You can also train our tree and help expanding it, giving more specificity to out algorithm.
